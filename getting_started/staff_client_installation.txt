index term:[staff client, installation, Mac, OS X]

. Using the update link above, navigate to the Mac OS X Staff client link at the bottom of the page.
  Open the .dmg file and follow the instructions to install on your staff machine.


Installing on Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[staff client, installation, Linux]

. On the Evergreen *server*, navigate to the `staff_client` directory inside
  the Evergreen source:
+
[source, bash]
--------
cd  /path/to/Evergreen/Open-ILS/xul/staff_client
--------
+
. As the *root* user, build release versions of staff clients for both
  32-bit and 64-bit Linux systems:
+
[source, bash]
--------
make rigrelease rebuild linux32-updates-client linux64-updates-client
--------
+
This builds and copies two staff client tarballs for Linux to the `updates`
directory on the Web server.
+
. As the *root* user, reset the ownership of the Evergreen install directory
  to the *opensrf* user. For example, if your install directory is `/openils`:
+
[source, bash]
--------
chown -R opensrf:opensrf /openils
--------
+
. On your staff client workstation, download the 32-bit or 64-bit version of
  the staff client from your Web server at
  http://hostname/updates/manualupdate.html (where _hostname_ represents the
  hostname of your Web server).
. On your staff client workstation, create a directory with the name of your
  staff client and version.
. Extract the tar files into that directory.
. Within the directory, click on the `evergreen` file to start the program.
+
Or, you can run the program from a terminal (command line). For example, if the
staff client files were extracted to a directory called `evergreen_client` in
your home directory, you can run it with:
+
[source, bash]
--------
~/evergreen_client/evergreen
--------

not have these permissions, ask your system administrator for assistance.

Removing Staff Client Preferences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[staff client, removing user settings]

Windows
^^^^^^^

When you uninstall the Evergreen staff client code from your system, the staff
client preferences and cached data are not removed from your system. This can
be a problem if, for example, you have registered your workstation with the
wrong library; or if you have chosen a display language (locale) that is broken
and will not let you start up the client again

On Windows, you can uninstall the Evergreen staff client code using the
Add/Remove Programs menu.

To remove the staff client preferences and cached data entirely on Windows,
there are two directories that you must delete completely (where _<profile>_
represents your user profile name):

* *C:\Documents and Settings\<profile>\Application Data\OpenILS*
* *C:\Documents and Settings\<profile>\Local Settings\Application Data\OpenILS*

You might need to change the preferences in Windows Explorer to display hidden
files (Tools -> Folder Optionsâ€¦ -> View).
 
Linux
^^^^^

To remove the staff client preferences and cached data from your user account
on Linux, there is one directory that you must delete completely: 

[source, bash]
----------
rm -fr ~/.openils
----------
